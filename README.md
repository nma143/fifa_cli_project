# FifaCliProject

This gem is a cli app that lists the teams in the Fifa 2018 tournament (scraped from https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/). If the user selects a team in the list, information on each of the team's
players will be displayed.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fifa_cli_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fifa_cli_project

## Usage

To run this gem run `./fifa`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
